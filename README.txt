Hello! First off, make sure to change the paths written on the lines 193 and 194 of the Project_SDL1.cpp file to match the real path
the pictures are located at.

That's pretty much all there is to say about this project. I covered all the guidelines given for the first part of the project.
I also added the handling of the window closing event, as trivial as it may sound.

To run the program, go to the root of your project and just cd cmake-build-debug/Project_SDL_Part1_base and
./SDL_Part1 [nsheep] [nwolves] [program duration in ms]. :)
