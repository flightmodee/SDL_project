# SDL_project
A student project realized during a C++ workshop at ESIEE Paris. It's a simple game developped with the SDL library, where you play as a shepherd whose goal is to defend his frail sheep from the ruthless wrath of the wolves.

If you want to try it, make sure to change the paths written on the lines 193 and 194 of the Project_SDL1.cpp file to match the real path
the pictures are located at.

That's pretty much all there is to say about this project.

To run the program, go to the root of your project and just cd cmake-build-debug/Project_SDL_Part1_base and
./SDL_Part1 [nsheep] [nwolves] [program duration in ms], nsheep and nwolves being the number of sheep, and wolves that will initially spawn.
